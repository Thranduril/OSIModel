        <div id="layer1"><h4>Layer 7 - Application</h4><p>The application layer is where the user inputs data and data is output to the user. The application layer is usually software that is run off the local machine, however this depends on the network architecture. The software could be cloud based, meaning it runs off a server in a remote location and data is transferred over the internet, or the software could be run on a local server. The application layer provides services for email, Telnet and file Transfer for example. An example of the application layer is an internet browser, an FTP client or even Microsoft Word.</p></div>
        <div id="layer2"><h4>Layer 6 - Presentation</h4><p>The presentation layer is where the operating system lies. This operating system could be Windows, OS X, a Unix based operating system or one of the many others available. Where the human user interacts with the application layer described above, the application layer interacts with the presentation layer.</p></div>
        <div id="layer3"><h4>Layer 5 - Session</h4><p>The session layer is responsible for creating and maintaining sessions between the operating system on the presentation layer and other, third party machines. For example, when a user is browsing the internet, they are interacting with the application layer, the application layer is interacting with the presentation layer and the session layer allows the operating system to interact with the web server.</p></div>
        <div id="layer4"><h4>Layer 4 - Transport</h4><p>The transport layer is responsible for the logistics of the session. In the example used above, the transport layer would be responsible for determining what and how much information is transferred between the operating system and the web server.</p></div>
        <div id="layer5"><h4>Layer 3 - Transport</h4><p>The network layer is where routers operate. A router is a hardware device that forwards packets of information between computers on a network. This is where your IP address comes from and the router is responsible for sending packets of information out into the internet and receiving them. These packets origin and destination is determined by the IP address of your router.</p></div>
        <div id="layer6"><h4>Layer 2 - Transport</h4><p>The data link layer is where switches operate, it creates a reliable link between two connected points.. The data link layer is also responsible for detecting and possibly fixing any packet errors that may form on the physical layer.</p></div>
        <div id="layer7"><h4>Layer 1 - Transport</h4><p>The physical layer is literally the physical hardware that makes up the network. This comes in the form of cables and all physical hardware involved.</p></div>
